    [FIX] account: Allow multiple records while renaming taxes
    
    Since the unique name constraint only works for the active language,
    it's possible to have more than one tax with the same name in another language.
    
    If that's the case, a `ValueError: Expected singleton` error will occur while
    retrieving the fields in `unique_tax_name_key`.
    
    Found in upg-2077316.

    [FIX] mrp: fix undeterministic timing error on test_order
    
    test_duration_expected_when_done was undeterministically failing,
    if the test ran at specific times, the difference in minutes between
    button_start and button_finish functions was rounded incorrectly.
    having time frozen should solve this behavior.

    [FIX] point_of_sale: fix order reference in qr code payment
    
    To be compliant with belgium we need to fix the reference of the order
    in the qr code payment.
    
    If we have 12 digits at the end of the reference, it considers it as a
    structured reference but isn't. So we also add the tracking number at
    the end of the reference.

    [FIX] cli: obfuscate partner complete name
    
    before this commit, for obfuscating data in the
    res.partner model, the display_name field is used,
    which is non stored field and thus in the log,
    an error/warning is shown as follows while
    running obfuscate command
    
    odoo.cli.obfuscate: Invalid fields: res_partner.display_name
    
    the invalid warning is raised as the field is not
    a stored field and thus removing it from the
    obfuscation
    
    even though, the res.partner name field is obfuscated,
    the same data is remaining in the complete_name
    field, so adding this field to obfuscating field list
    
    after this commit, the log will not show the
    invalid field warning and complete name also
    will be obfuscated

    [FIX] repair: clear the lot when changing the product
    
    **Steps to reproduce the bug:**
    - Create two storable products, ‚ÄúP1‚Äù and ‚ÄúP2‚Äù.
    - Set ‚ÄúP1‚Äù to be tracked by Serial Number
    - Update P1 with SN1.
    - Create a repair order:
       - Set P1 with SN1.
       - Save.
    - Edit and update the product to P2.
    - Save.
    - Print the order.
    
    **Problem:**
    The ‚Äúlot_id‚Äù is not cleared and appears in the report because the
    ‚Äúlot_id‚Äù field becomes invisible and read-only under the same condition.
    Since it is read-only and not force-saved, the value of ‚Äúlot_id‚Äù is not
    considered in the write of the repair order, even though the `onchange`
    sets the ‚Äúlot_id‚Äù field to False:

    [IMP] hr_holidays: clarify constraint on negative balance
    
    Before this commit, the error message that the user receives
    once triggering the constraint on negative balances values was:
    "The negative amount must be greater than 0."
    which was a bit confusing by having side to side "negative" and "greater than 0"
    
    This commit rephrases that error message.

    [FIX] base: Prevent quick creation of `ir_model_fields`
    
    The problem can be reproduced in two ways
    - by finding a view that integrates a many2one on `ir.model.fields` used
    without no_create
    - manually add the field via studio on any view.
    
    I found a view with the problem: `marketing_campaign_view_form` which
    uses the field `unique_field_
